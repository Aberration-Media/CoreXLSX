## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

Model types in `CoreXLSX` directly map internal structure of XLSX format with
more sensible naming applied to a few attributes. The API is pretty simple:

```swift
import CoreXLSX

guard let file = XLSXFile(filepath: "./categories.xlsx") else {
  fatalError("XLSX file corrupted or does not exist")
}

for path in try file.parseWorksheetPaths() {
  let ws = try file.parseWorksheet(at: path)
  for row in ws.sheetData.rows {
    for c in row.cells {
      print(c)
    }
  }
}
```

This prints every cell from every worksheet in the given XLSX file. Please refer to the
[Worksheet model](./Sources/CoreXLSX/Worksheet.swift) for more atttributes you might
need to read from a parsed file.

If you stumble upon a file that can't be parsed, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX/issues) posting the exact
error message. Thanks to use of standard Swift `Codable` protocol, detailed errors are
generated listing a missing attribute, so it can be easily added to the model enabling 
broader format support.

## Requirements

Xcode 10, Swift 4.2, iOS 9.0 or macOS 10.11
